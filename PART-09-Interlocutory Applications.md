## 66. Filing of summonses 

***Summonses without notice and “by consent” summonses***

(1)	Summonses must be endorsed “without notice” or “by consent”, and when so endorsed must bear a certificate to that effect signed by all the solicitors concerned. Any summons that is not so endorsed will be regarded as a contentious matter liable to exceed a hearing duration of 10 minutes.

(2)	After the filing of any summons without notice or “by consent” summons, the application will be examined by the Judge or Registrar as the case may be. If the Judge or Registrar is satisfied that the application is in order and all other requirements have been complied with, the Judge or Registrar may make the order(s) applied for without the attendance of the applicant or his or her solicitor.

(3)	Summonses that are filed using the Electronic Filing Service will be routed to the inbox of the applicant solicitor’s Electronic Filing Service account. Where the summons is filed through the service bureau, it may be collected at the service bureau. Enquiries by telephone will not be entertained.

***Applications filed with the Court’s approval under Order 9, Rule 9(8) or (10) of the Rules of Court 2021***

(4)	Order 9, Rule 9(7) of the Rules of Court 2021 sets out the types of applications which may be taken out by any party at any time and without the Court’s direction or approval.

(5)	Order 9, Rule 9(8) and (10) of the Rules of Court 2021 state:
```
(8) The Court’s approval to file further applications other than those directed at a case conference must be sought by letter setting out the essence of the intended application and the reasons why it is necessary at that stage of the proceedings.

…
 

(10) No application may be taken out during the period starting 14 days before the commencement of the trial and ending when the Court has determined the merits of the action, except in a special case and with the trial Judge’s approval.
```
(6)	Where a party wishes to file further applications other than those directed at a case conference, the party must first obtain the Court’s approval by filing a Request in the manner and form prescribed in Form 9 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.

(7)	The party is to specify the nature and essence of the intended application, the date of filing of the intended application and the reason(s) why the intended application is necessary at that stage of the proceedings.

(8)	Where the intended application is to be filed:

<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	subsequent to the single application pending trial (“SAPT”), the party must specify why the intended application could not have been dealt with under the SAPT; and</li>

<li>(b)	during the period starting 14 days before the commencement of the trial and ending when the Court has determined the merits of the action, the party must specify why this is a special case.</li>
</ul>

(9)	Where the intended application is filed subsequent to the SAPT and is one that should have been dealt with under the SAPT (“subsequent application”), the relevant fees for the subsequent application are as stipulated under item 7(k), Part 1 of the Fourth Schedule to the Rules of Court 2021 as follows:
