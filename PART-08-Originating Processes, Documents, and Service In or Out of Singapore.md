***Parties not named in the title of the documents***

(2)	Where a party to any proceedings in the Supreme Court first files a document in such proceedings, and the name of the party does not appear in the title of the document but does appear in the body of the document, the identification number of the party should be provided in accordance with the Electronic Filing System data entry fields for identification number.

***Documents filed by 2 or more parties***

(3)	Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply, with the necessary modifications, to documents which are filed by more than 1 party.

***Identification numbers for non-parties***

(4)	If any person (living or dead), any entity or any property is the subject matter of any proceedings, or is affected by any proceedings, but is not a party to the proceedings, and the name of such person, entity or property is to appear in the title of the documents filed in the proceedings, the party filing the first document in the proceedings must provide the identification number of such person, entity or property in accordance with the Electronic Filing System data entry fields for identification number. If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he or she may state “(ID No. Not Known)”.

<li>(d)	for bankruptcy matters, the creditor must, in addition to his or her own identification number, also provide the identification number of the debtor in the first document filed by the creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings.</li>
</ul>
***Identification numbers***

(6)	When entering the identification number in the Electronic Filing Service, the full identification number, including the letters before and after the number should be entered.

***Guidelines for the selection of identification numbers***

(7)	The following guidelines should be followed in deciding on the appropriate identification number:
```
NATURAL PERSON WITH SINGAPORE IDENTITY CARD

(a)	For a natural person who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, the identification number is the number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act. The 7-digit number as well as the letters at the front and end should be stated. For example, “(NRIC No. S1234567A)”.

NATURAL PERSON WITH FIN NUMBER

(b)	For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act, but has been assigned a FIN number under the Immigration Regulations, the identification number is the FIN number. The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.”

NATURAL PERSON: BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR PASSPORT NUMBER

(c)	For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act or assigned a FIN number, the identification number is the birth certificate or passport number. The number should be preceded by either of the following, as appropriate: “(Issuing country) BC No.” or “(Issuing country) PP No.”

NATURAL PERSON: OTHER NUMBERS

(d)	For a natural person who is not a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and has not been assigned a FIN number and does not have a birth certificate or passport number, the identification number is the number of any identification document he or she may possess. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority issuing the identification document to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Japanese Identification Card No.”

DECEASED PERSON

(e)	For a deceased natural person, the identification number must be as set out in sub-paragraph 7(a) to (d) above. However, if such numbers are not available, the identification number is the death registration number under the Registration of Births and Deaths Rules or the equivalent foreign provisions, where the death is registered abroad. The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.”

COMPANY REGISTERED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT

(f)	For a company registered under the Companies Act, the identification number is the Unique Entity Number (UEN).

COMPANY REGISTERED OUTSIDE SINGAPORE

(g)	For a company registered outside Singapore which is not registered under the Companies Act, the identification number is the registration number of the company in the country of registration.

BUSINESS REGISTERED UNDER THE BUSINESS NAMES REGISTRATION ACT 2014

(h)	For a body registered under the Business Names Registration Act 2014, the identification number is the UEN number.

LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP REGISTERED UNDER THE LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIPS ACT

(i)	For a limited liability partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act, the identification number is the UEN number.

OTHER BODIES AND ASSOCIATIONS

(j)	For any other body or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, which does not fall within sub-paragraph 7(f) to (i), the identification number is any unique number assigned to the body or association by any authority. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority assigning the number to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Singapore Trade Union Reg. No. 123 A”.

SHIP OR VESSEL

(k)	For a ship or vessel, the identification number is the registration number assigned by the port of registry. If no such registration number is available, the identification number assigned by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) or the number of the license granted by any authority is the identification number.

NO IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS EXIST

(l)	Where the appropriate identification numbers prescribed by   sub- paragraph (7)(a) to (k) do not exist, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of the party, person, entity or property concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”.
```
***Inability to furnish identification number at the time of filing a document***

(8)	If a party who wishes to file a document is unable at the time of filing to furnish the necessary identification numbers required by this paragraph, the party may indicate “(ID No. Not Known)” at the time of filing. However, when the necessary identification numbers have been obtained, the party will have to furnish the necessary identification numbers to the Registry through the Electronic Filing Service.

***Meaning of document***

(9)	To avoid doubt, the words “document” and “documents” when used in this paragraph include all originating processes filed in the Supreme Court regardless of whether they are governed by the Rules of Court 2021. The words also include all documents filed in connection with bankruptcy proceedings.

***Non-compliance***

(10)	Any document which does not comply with this paragraph may be rejected for filing by the Registry.

## 59. Endorsements on originating processes and other documents 

(1)	Where it is necessary to include endorsements on any document, the directions in this paragraph apply.

(2)	Endorsements are normally made on originating processes and other documents to show renewal and amendments. Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not require the Registrar’s signature as they are made pursuant to either an order of court or the Rules of Court 2021. The Registrar should therefore not be asked to sign such endorsements.

(3)	For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms composed online:
<ul type="*">
<li>(a)	Solicitors should select the appropriate endorsement, and check the accuracy of the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or other document. The acceptance by the Registry of electronic forms composed online does not affect the regularity of any endorsements on the document.</li>

<li>(b)	Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document, those endorsements must be incorporated into the document before the document is filed or issued.</li>
 
<li>(c)	Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements must be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case may be. An example of this would be renewals of originating claims.</li>
</ul>
