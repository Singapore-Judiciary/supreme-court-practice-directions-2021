(3) Counsel in criminal appeals, criminal motions and criminal references before the Court of Appeal should ensure that 4 hard copies of any skeletal arguments are tendered to the Legal Registry.

(For example, if the sitting period starts on Monday, 18 February 2019 and ends on Friday, 8 March 2019, all skeletal arguments for matters listed before the Court of Appeal in that sitting period must be filed by 4 p.m. on Monday, 28 January 2019.)</li>
