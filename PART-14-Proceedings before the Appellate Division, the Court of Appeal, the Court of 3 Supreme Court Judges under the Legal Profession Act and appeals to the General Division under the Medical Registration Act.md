			<ul type="*">

				<li>(iii)	<strong>Volume III</strong> – Affidavits (in chronological order), and transcripts or notes of evidence and arguments.</li>

				<li>(iii)	<strong>Volume III</strong> – Affidavits (in chronological order), and transcripts or notes of evidence and arguments.

				<li>(iv)	<strong>Volume IV</strong> – All such exhibits and documents as they were tendered in the lower Court, but which did not form an exhibit to any affidavit.</li>

				<li>(v)	<strong>Volume V</strong> – The Agreed Bundle (if any) in its original physical form as it was tendered in the lower Court.</li>
			</ul>

<li>(b)	Where there are no exhibits or documents referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(a)(iv) above, Volume IV need not be produced, and Volume V must be renumbered as Volume IV.</li>

<li>(c)	To facilitate cross-referencing, any supplemental record of appeal must be arranged in the following manner in 1 volume:</li>

Conversely, if any of the volumes (with the exception of Volumes I and II which must remain as separate volumes) should be less than 100 pages each, these may be amalgamated into combined volumes, each not exceeding 300 pages, and renumbered accordingly.</li>
